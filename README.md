# Named-Entity-Recognition

This project performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a BiLSTM-based model. I used *NER dataset.csv* uploaded above. It includes:

**Tag.ipynb** – NER tagger for preprocessing and tagging the dataset by using BiLSTM.

**POS.ipynb** – POS tagger model using BiLSTM.

**NER.ipynb** – Final NER model that loads the tagger and POS tagger, and uses them together for entity recognition.
